* Lab 1: mapreduce, get familiar with golang.
* Lab 2: primary/backup key/value service, configuration is changed called view.
* Lab 3: paxos and paxos based key/value service.
* Lab 4: sharded paxos based key/value service.

First `export GOPATH=~/[your folder]`, then try to run `go test`.  
The last lab is the most difficult, still have two failed cases, take a shot!
