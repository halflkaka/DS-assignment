# Distributed System
Implementation for [MIT 6.824](http://css.csail.mit.edu/6.824/2014/), Distributed System. Also the course of Columbia University (https://columbia.github.io/ds1-class/). 

* Lab 1: mapreduce, get familiar with golang.
* Lab 2: primary/backup key/value service, configuration is changed called view.
* Lab 3: paxos and paxos based key/value service.
* Lab 4: sharded paxos based key/value service.

First `export GOPATH=~/Distributed`, then try to run `go test`.  
The last lab is the most difficult, still have two failed cases, take a shot!
